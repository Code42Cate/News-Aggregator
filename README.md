# Google News s****

This project is the solution to my frustration which Google News caused for way too long.

I read a lot of news articles everyday, but I usually don't have the time to scout on multiple news site for articles that interest me. So I've been using different news aggregator sites for a long time, up until now Google News on my phone was the best choice.


The problem with Google News was, that their ********* algorithms are way too ********* sensitive and whenever I read any controversial article I instantly saw how hard they are trying to put me into a bubble.
The results of getting into a bubble where, that I only got the most boring mainstream articles about the same topics, _every freaking day_. I don't know you, but I read to learn about new topics and to think about different perspectives/opinions, not to get confirmation by 100s of articles every day that my opinion is the correct one >:(

### Okay, enough rant. We have a problem? Whats the solution?
### Let's build our own news aggregator!
